# Python Demo

This repository contains a series of demo applications for
the RadarIQ sensor which are written in Python.

These applications are designed to use the PointCloud or ObjectTracking modes.

## CMD Capture
This application allows for the capture of Point Cloud radar data into point cloud formats which can be 
opened with 3rd party point cloud visualisation software.
