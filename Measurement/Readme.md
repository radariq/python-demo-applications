# Approximate Distance Measurement

This program is a measurement application for 
use with the RadarIQ mmRadar module. The app 
demonstrates how the module may be utilized 
to take approximate distance measurements of an 
object within 10 meters.

Note: Very accurate distance measurement is possible
using different firmware, running specialist algorithms.
This application is only for approximate measurement using
the Point Cloud data.

With the module connected to the computer
via USB run ``` python distance_measurement.py ``` 
on the command line. Manually enter the
name of the COM port the for the device in 
the settings section or choose the detect option 
besides the field to let the program discover the 
device. Pressing the "Measure" button will return the
distance to the first object in range.

The capture parameters of distance, angle, and
height can be adjusted to optimize the measurement.
These are filters. Any readings from outside 
the specified range will be ignored when 
calculating distance. Consider the following example:

![Example](assets/readme/RIQ_Example.jpg)
 
In the pictured example, an approximate measurement is
taken between the sensor and the object behind 
the glass. The minimum distance is set 2050 mm and
maximum to 5000mm. A measurement reading will now 
ignore the glass, and the application will return
the distance to the next detected object in range.
